Seneca is one of my favorite philosophers and possibly the most accessible and relevant philosopher of ancient Rome and today. A Stoic, statesman, and tutor to Emperor Nero, Seneca wrote extensively on how to live a good life amidst the chaos of politics, ambition, and human frailty. His essays and letters are filled with practical wisdom on topics like time management, anger, grief, and friendship.

What I appreciate most about Seneca is the approachability and relevance of his writing. There are so many resources online to read Seneca's works for free, including [this collection of his letters](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Moral_letters_to_Lucilius) and [his essay On the Shortness of Life](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/On_the_Shortness_of_Life). I highly recommend starting with these two works.
