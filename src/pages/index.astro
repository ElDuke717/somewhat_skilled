				I have some skills across many domains. In many domains, I have a decent level of competence and knowledge.

			<p>
				Here Iâ€™ll share thoughts, ideas, and reflections on various topics that interest me, from philosophy, technology, science to art and culture.  I work with computers, wood, and ideas. I know a lot about food. I like to think about how things work and why they matter.

				Thank you for visiting, and I hope these reflections are interesting and spark ideas of your own.
